<h1>Introduction</h1>
Instacart is an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products.
